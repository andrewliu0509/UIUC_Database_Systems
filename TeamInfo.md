## Project Summary

RobinSpot is a real estate analytics platform that helps not only home buyers but also investors gain a better understanding of US housing market trends. The dataset this project uses contains both historical and current data on supply, demand, prices, and location of units across the country. Therefore, we can show current prices on a heatmap and provide different analytical metrics such as price growth rate, turnover rate, and liquidity index for users to query, and present the analytics in an interactive format.
